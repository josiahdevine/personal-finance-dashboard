# Personal Finance Dashboard: Project Status Documentation

## Current Development Status

We are currently in the testing phase of the Personal Finance Dashboard application. The application is a React-based web platform with features for tracking personal finances, bills analysis, and integration with Plaid for bank connectivity.

### Recently Fixed Issues

1. **Circular Dependency Resolution**:
   - Fixed circular dependencies in date-fns imports
   - Updated `patchedDateFns.js` to use specific function imports rather than default imports
   - Aligned imports in both desktop and mobile versions of components

2. **BillsAnalysis Component Repair**:
   - Completely rewrote the BillsAnalysis component to fix syntax and structure issues
   - Added proper state management with useState hooks
   - Implemented mock data generation for development testing
   - Created clean UI with Tailwind CSS styling
   - Added CSV import functionality with proper error handling

3. **PlaidLinkContext Integration**:
   - Verified proper implementation of PlaidLinkContext and PlaidLinkProvider
   - Confirmed correct imports in App.js and BillsAnalysis component

## Current Issues

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - PowerShell doesn't support '&&' as a statement separator 
   - Error: `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version`

2. **Port Conflict**:
   - Something is already running on port 3000
   - System is asking whether to run on another port

3. **Possible Remaining Issues**:
   - There might be implementation details in the BillsAnalysis component that need refinement
   - The setTimeout function in the handleFileUpload method may need proper completion
   - Proper error handling for Plaid connection failures

## Testing Status

1. **Completed Tests**:
   - Static code analysis (fixed syntax errors)
   - Structure and dependency validation

2. **Pending Tests**:
   - Runtime functionality testing
   - Integration testing with mock data
   - UI/UX flow testing
   - Responsive design testing

## Next Steps

1. **Application Launch**:
   - Restart the application with proper command syntax for PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     cd "C:\Users\josia\OneDrive\Desktop\Website\personal-finance-dashboard"; npm start
     ```
   - Respond 'Y' to the prompt about using another port

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Test CSV file upload functionality
   - Verify mock data display
   - Test Plaid connection simulation

3. **UI/UX Review**:
   - Validate responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Check accessibility features
   - Verify intuitive user flow

4. **Data Flow Verification**:
   - Ensure proper storage and retrieval from localStorage
   - Verify proper state management across component lifecycle
   - Test error handling for various edge cases

## Component Structure

The BillsAnalysis component includes:

1. **State Management**:
   - Transaction data with proper typing
   - UI state (loading, errors, import status)
   - Form fields for expense management

2. **Core Functionality**:
   - Fetch transactions from Plaid or fallback to local storage
   - Generate mock data when needed
   - Process CSV imports with intelligent categorization
   - Identify bills based on transaction properties

3. **User Interface**:
   - Clean, responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
   - Loading indicators and error messages
   - Transaction table with filtering options
   - Import options with CSV upload support

## Getting Started for New Development

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed (v14+ recommended)
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

2. **Running the Application**:
   - In PowerShell, use semicolons for command separation:
     ```
     cd "C:\Users\josia\OneDrive\Desktop\Website\personal-finance-dashboard"; npm start
     ```
   - Alternatively, navigate to the directory first, then run npm start:
     ```
     cd "C:\Users\josia\OneDrive\Desktop\Website\personal-finance-dashboard"
     npm start
     ```

3. **Building for Production**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
