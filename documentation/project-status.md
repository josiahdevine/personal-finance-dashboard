- [ ] Update color system
- [ ] Add new typography
- [ ] Create animation utilities
- [ ] Update core UI components

### Phase 2: Enhanced Interactions (Planned)
- [ ] Implement micro-interactions
- [ ] Add page transitions
- [ ] Enhance mobile experience
- [ ] Optimize performance

### Phase 3: Data Visualization (Planned)
- [ ] Upgrade chart components
- [ ] Add advanced interactions
- [ ] Implement data animations
- [ ] Optimize for all devices

### Phase 4: Polish (Planned)
- [ ] Add final animations
- [ ] Optimize accessibility
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Upcoming Tasks
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle sizes
   - Add performance monitoring

2. Developer Experience
   - Complete TypeScript migration
   - Improve development environment setup
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Implement better error handling

3. Testing
   - Add unit test coverage
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add end-to-end testing
   - Improve test documentation

4. Deployment
   - Optimize build caching
   - Improve CI/CD pipeline
   - Add deployment validation
   - Implement staging environment

## Known Issues
- Case sensitivity in imports needs to be standardized
- Some components need TypeScript conversion
- Build process could be optimized further
- UI components need modernization updates
- Port 3000 conflicts need resolution (process 13868 currently using the port)
- Need to address remaining ESLint warnings in utility files
- Need to secure remaining sensitive information in other configuration files

## Next Release Goals
- Complete Phase 1 of UI modernization
- Complete TypeScript migration
- Implement all planned performance optimizations
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Improve developer documentation
