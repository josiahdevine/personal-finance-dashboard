# Mobile Development Roadmap

This document outlines our plans, priorities, and current status for enhancing the mobile experience in the Personal Finance Dashboard application.

## Current Status (Updated)

The Personal Finance Dashboard application now has significantly improved mobile support with recent enhancements to the mobile navigation and Financial Goals component. We've implemented a modern bottom navigation bar with animations, haptic feedback, and improved touch interactions. The Financial Goals component now features a mobile-optimized card view with swipe gestures for actions.

### Existing Mobile Components

1. **AccountConnectionsMobile.js** - Optimized version of account connections for mobile
2. **SubscriptionPlansMobile.js** - Mobile view of subscription plans 
3. **MobileLayout.js** - Container component with mobile-specific navigation
4. **TransactionsList.js** - Transactions list with responsive views for mobile/desktop
5. **FinancialGoals.js** - Now features mobile-optimized card view with swipe gestures
6. **FinancialCharts.js** - New responsive data visualization component with touch interactions

## Current Issues & Limitations

1. **Inconsistent UX between desktop and mobile** - Not all features are implemented with mobile-specific optimizations
2. **Performance issues on slower mobile devices** - Some components are too heavy for mobile browsers
3. **Touch target issues** - Some UI elements are too small for comfortable touch interaction
