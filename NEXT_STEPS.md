## Priority Tasks

1. **Finalize Component Directory Structure**
   - Run the standardization script to ensure all component paths are consistent
   - Verify imports are working correctly after standardization
   - Update any remaining hardcoded references to the Components directory
   - Test the application thoroughly to detect any missed imports

2. **Update Production Deployment**
   - Create a pre-deployment checklist to ensure all tests pass
   - Add environment-specific configuration validation
   - Test the production build locally before deploying
   - Document production deployment process for future reference

3. **Address Remaining UI Issues**
   - Complete responsive design testing on various device sizes
   - Fix any layout inconsistencies in mobile views
   - Ensure accessibility standards are met
   - Test UI components with different data scenarios

## Stripe Integration
1. **Configure Stripe Keys:**
   - Create a Stripe account if you don't have one
   - Add your Stripe API keys to your environment variables:
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (server-side)
     - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (client-side)

2. **Set Up Stripe Webhook:**
   - In your Stripe dashboard, create a webhook endpoint pointing to `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/webhook`
   - Configure the following events:
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret to your server environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. **Run Database Migrations:**
   - Execute the SQL migration file to create subscription-related tables:
     ```
     cd server
     node run-migration.js migrations/20231005_create_subscription_tables.sql
     ```

## Testing Payment Flow
1. **Test the subscription process:**
   - Use Stripe test cards (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242` for successful payments)
   - Test both monthly and annual subscription plans
   - Verify successful subscription creation in both your database and Stripe dashboard

2. **Test webhook handling:**
   - Use Stripe's webhook testing feature to simulate events
   - Verify subscription status changes are properly reflected in your database

## Security Implementation
1. **Integrate encryption utilities with existing data:**
   - Update components that handle sensitive financial data to use the encryption utilities
   - Add encryption for:
     - Transaction data
     - Account balances

     - Financial goals

2. **Add user password confirmation for encryption:**
   - Create a UI component to enable/disable encryption
   - Implement password confirmation flow when enabling encryption
   - Add recovery options documentation for users

## Mobile Responsiveness

   - Test the mobile layouts on various screen sizes (iPhone, Android, tablets)
   - Verify proper function of touch-friendly elements
   - Test swipe gestures on subscription cards

2. **Add mobile-optimized versions of remaining pages:**
   - Implement mobile versions for:
     - Dashboard
     - Transactions page
     - Goals page
     - Settings/profile page

## Performance Optimization
1. **Implement lazy loading:**
   - Add code-splitting for large components
   - Lazy load components that aren't immediately needed

2. **Optimize API calls:**
   - Add caching for frequently used data
   - Implement debouncing for search inputs
   - Add pagination for transaction lists
