   - Optimize bundle sizes
   - Add performance monitoring

2. Developer Experience
   - Complete TypeScript migration
   - Improve development environment setup
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Implement better error handling

3. Testing
   - Add unit test coverage
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add end-to-end testing
   - Improve test documentation

4. Deployment
   - Optimize build caching
   - Improve CI/CD pipeline
   - Add deployment validation
   - Implement staging environment

## Known Issues
- Case sensitivity in imports needs to be standardized
- Some components need TypeScript conversion
- Build process could be optimized further

## Next Release Goals
- Complete TypeScript migration
- Implement all planned performance optimizations
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Improve developer documentation
