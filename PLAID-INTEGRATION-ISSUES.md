## Error Patterns

### Before Implementation
```javascript
Current Error:
[API] ERROR: No response received from /.netlify/functions/plaid/link-token
[PlaidContext] API call failed, attempt 1/3
Network Error: {url: '/api/plaid/transactions', method: 'get', message: 'Network Error'}
```

### Expected After Implementation
```javascript
Expected Pattern:
[API] DEBUG: Starting Plaid operation
[API] INFO: Request initiated with ID: xxx
[API] ERROR: Specific error with code and details
[API] DEBUG: Retry attempt 1/3 with backoff
```

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Phase 1
2. Review and update documentation as changes are made
3. Test each component after implementation
4. Document any deviations from expected behavior
5. Update error handling based on observed patterns

## Notes
- All changes must be tested in isolation before integration
- Document any deviations from expected behavior
- Update this document as implementation progresses
- Track all error patterns for future reference
