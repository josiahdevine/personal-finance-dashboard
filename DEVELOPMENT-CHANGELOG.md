### Directory Structure Standardization

1. **Component Directory Standardization**:
   - Standardized all component imports to use lowercase 'components' directory
   - Updated import statements across the codebase for consistent paths
   - Resolved potential case-sensitivity issues for deployment environments
   - Fixed circular dependency issues by ensuring consistent import paths
   
This change improves compatibility with case-sensitive filesystems (like Linux servers) and eliminates potential deployment issues when files are referenced with inconsistent casing.

## Bug Fixes and Technical Improvements (2023-07-21)

### Resolved Issues
1. **Fixed Root Route Error**: Created a `RootRouteHandler` component to properly access the authentication context and handle redirects based on login state.
   - Location: `src/App.js`
   - Fix: Moved the root path redirection logic into a separate component that correctly uses the `useAuth` hook.

2. **Stripe Integration Improvements**: Enhanced Stripe integration to gracefully handle missing API keys.
   - Location: `src/utils/stripeUtils.js` and `src/App.js`
   - Changes:
     - Created utility functions for Stripe initialization
     - Added conditional rendering for Stripe Elements
     - Improved error handling for missing API keys

3. **Dashboard Layout PropTypes Fix**: Updated `DashboardLayout` component to correctly use React Router's `Outlet`.
   - Location: `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.js`
   - Fix: Removed the unnecessary `children` PropType since the component uses `Outlet` instead.

4. **Environment Configuration**: Added a comprehensive `.env.example` file with documentation for required environment variables.
   - New file: `.env.example`
   - Purpose: Assists developers in setting up the correct environment variables for local development.

### Development Environment Tips
- When running the application locally, you may need to disable ad blockers that could interfere with API calls to Stripe or other services.
- For Stripe testing, use the test keys provided in the Stripe dashboard. The keys should always start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` for testing environments.
- The application now gracefully handles missing API keys to prevent crashes during development.

## Bug Fixes and Technical Improvements (2023-07-22)

### Resolved Critical Issues

1. **Fixed date-fns Module Conflict**: Resolved the "conflicting star exports for the name 'longFormatters'" error in date-fns.
   - **Root Cause**: The date-fns library had conflicting exports between `./parse.js` and `./format.js` modules.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created a patched version of date-fns in `src/utils/patchedDateFns.js`
     - Added import overrides in `src/utils/importFixer.js` 
     - Implemented a comprehensive date utility using dayjs in `src/utils/dateUtils.js`
     - Configured webpack aliases in craco.config.js to redirect problematic imports

2. **Added CRACO Configuration**: Implemented custom webpack configuration with CRACO.
   - Location: `craco.config.js`
   - Features:
     - Custom module resolution for conflicting packages
     - Optimized bundle splitting for date libraries
     - Special handling for problematic modules

### Development Setup Improvements

1. **Enhanced Date Utilities**: Created a robust date utility module based on dayjs.

   - Features:
     - Comprehensive date formatting and parsing
     - Relative time calculations
     - Date difference calculations
     - Compatible API with date-fns for easy migration

2. **Build Process Enhancement**: Added custom build configuration.

   - Added simulated delays and random data variations for realistic mock behavior

2. **Error Prevention and Defensive Programming**:
   - Added comprehensive null/undefined checks throughout the codebase
   - Implemented synthetic events when needed for component interaction
   - Enhanced toast notifications with more informative error messages
   - Ensured all user-facing interactions remain functional even when backend services are unavailable

### Steps to Test Locally

1. Run the application in a local development environment
2. Use the "Connect Via Plaid" button to test mock account creation
3. Use the "Sync Balances" button to test mock balance updates
4. Verify the application remains functional with networking disabled
5. Test the Toggle components to ensure they operate correctly 

## 2023-05-16

### Function Naming Standardization

1. **SalaryJournal Component Fixes**:
   - Renamed `calculateTaxProgressive` to `calculateProgressiveTax` to match function usage
   - Updated function implementation to handle tax brackets correctly
   - Fixed ESLint errors related to undefined functions
   - Updated standardize-components.js script to automatically handle this renaming

2. **Development Environment Documentation**:
   - Added section in DEVELOPMENT-NEXT-STEPS.md about Windows PowerShell command syntax
   - Documented that `&&` operator doesn't work in PowerShell for command chaining
   - Provided alternative approaches for running sequential commands in PowerShell

This standardization improves code consistency and reduces ESLint errors while ensuring proper functionality of tax calculations.
