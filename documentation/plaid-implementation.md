idx_balance_history_user_timestamp
idx_plaid_transactions_user_id
idx_plaid_transactions_date
idx_plaid_transactions_account_id
idx_plaid_webhooks_item_id
```

## Identified Issues & Recommendations

### Current Production Issues

1. **Link Token Creation Failure:** 
   - Error: "Failed to create link token for Plaid"
   - This appears to be an API initialization issue based on console logs
   - Potential causes: Missing API credentials, incorrect environment setup, or backend connectivity issues

2. **Account Loading Failure:**
   - Error: "Failed to load accounts. Please try again later."
   - This may be related to authentication issues or database connectivity problems

3. **Firebase Authentication Issues:**
   - Error: "Anonymous sign in failed: auth/admin-restricted-operation"
   - This suggests a configuration issue with Firebase authentication

4. **Network Resource Loading Failures:**
   - Several "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT" errors
   - These may be related to content blockers or CORS issues

### Critical Issues (Previously Identified)

1. **Hardcoded Credentials:** ✅ FIXED
   - Credentials have been moved to environment variables in `server/plaid.js`
   - ✅ Configuration now properly reads from .env files

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Current error handling doesn't adequately address common Plaid API issues
   - **Recommendation:** Implement more robust error handling, especially for authentication issues and rate limits

3. **Account Linking:**
   - The `Failed to create link token for plaid` error indicates issues with the token creation process
   - **Recommendation:** Implement better logging and retry mechanisms for link token creation

4. **Environment Configuration:** ✅ IMPROVED
   - The application now properly uses the environment specified in PLAID_ENV
   - ✅ Configuration supports sandbox, development, and production environments

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Token Security:**
   - Access tokens should be encrypted in the database
   - **Recommendation:** Implement field-level encryption for sensitive Plaid data

2. **Webhook Implementation:**
   - Current implementation doesn't fully utilize Plaid webhooks for real-time updates
   - **Recommendation:** Implement webhook handlers for transaction updates, item status changes, and error notifications

3. **Transaction Sync Strategy:**
   - The current implementation doesn't handle pagination and rate limits optimally
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a more robust transaction sync strategy with cursor-based pagination and exponential backoff

4. **Caching Layer:**
   - Frequent API calls to Plaid can hit rate limits
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data

5. **Error Recovery:**
   - The system doesn't handle Plaid connection failures well
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a background job to periodically check and fix broken connections

### Database Improvements

1. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Create proper migrations for the Plaid-related tables:

```sql
-- Create table for storing Plaid items (connected bank accounts)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS plaid_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    plaid_item_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    plaid_access_token TEXT NOT NULL,
    plaid_institution_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    institution_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create table for storing account information
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS plaid_accounts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    plaid_item_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES plaid_items(plaid_item_id),
    plaid_account_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    official_name TEXT,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    subtype TEXT,
    mask TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create table for storing account balances over time
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS account_balances (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    plaid_account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES plaid_accounts(plaid_account_id),
    current_balance DECIMAL(19,4) NOT NULL,
    available_balance DECIMAL(19,4),
    limit_balance DECIMAL(19,4),
    iso_currency_code TEXT,
    unofficial_currency_code TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create table for storing balance history
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS balance_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    account_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(19,4) NOT NULL,
    is_liability BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB
);

-- Create index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_balance_history_user_timestamp 
ON balance_history(user_id, timestamp);
```

## Action Plan for Production Issues (Feb 26, 2023)

Based on our recent deployment and observed production errors, here's a prioritized action plan to address the current issues:

### 1. Fix API Initialization Issues

**Problem:** Browser console shows `[PlaidContext] ERROR: API not properly initialized` and "Failed to create link token for Plaid" errors.

**Actions:**
1. Check and update environment variables on production server:
   ```bash
   PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
   PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
   PLAID_ENV=development  # or 'production' if using Production API
   PLAID_PRODUCTS=transactions,auth,balance
   PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=US
   ```

2. Update server-side logging to provide more context:
   ```javascript
   // In server/plaid.js
   console.log('Plaid Environment Variables Check:');
   console.log(`- PLAID_CLIENT_ID: ${PLAID_CLIENT_ID ? 'Present' : 'MISSING'}`);
   console.log(`- PLAID_SECRET: ${PLAID_SECRET ? 'Present' : 'MISSING'}`);
   console.log(`- PLAID_ENV: ${PLAID_ENV || 'MISSING'}`);
   ```

3. Ensure CORS is properly configured on production:
   ```javascript
   // In server/index.js
   app.use(cors({
     origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://yourdomain.com',
     methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
     credentials: true
   }));
   ```

### 2. Address Firebase Authentication Issues

**Problem:** "Anonymous sign in failed: auth/admin-restricted-operation" errors in console.

**Actions:**
1. Verify Firebase project settings for production:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in methods
   - Ensure Anonymous Authentication is enabled if your app uses it
   - Check IP allowlist settings if they're enabled

2. Validate Firebase configuration in frontend:
   ```javascript
   // Check that these match the production Firebase project
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
     authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
     projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
     // ...other firebase config
   };
   ```

3. Implement more robust error handling for authentication:
   ```javascript
   // In AuthContext.js - improve error handling
   auth.signInAnonymously()
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error('Authentication error:', error.code, error.message);
       // Implement fallback mechanism or user-friendly error message
     });
   ```

### 3. Fix Network Resource Loading Issues

**Problem:** Many "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT" errors.

**Actions:**
1. Check if resources are being blocked by content blockers:
   - Test in incognito mode with extensions disabled
   - Verify that all essential resources are loading from trusted domains

2. Check for mixed content issues if site is served over HTTPS:
   - Ensure all resources (scripts, API calls) use HTTPS
   - Check for hardcoded HTTP URLs in the application

3. Review network requests and optimize:
   - Consider bundling API requests to reduce number of calls
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate

### 4. Implement Better Error Recovery

**Problem:** The UI shows "Failed to load accounts. Please try again later."

**Actions:**
1. Add retry mechanism for failed API calls:
   ```javascript
   // Implement retry logic for critical API calls
   const fetchWithRetry = async (url, options, maxRetries = 3) => {
     let lastError;
     for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
       try {
         return await fetch(url, options);
       } catch (error) {
         console.log(`Attempt ${i+1} failed, retrying...`);
         lastError = error;
         await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * Math.pow(2, i)));
       }
     }
     throw lastError;
   };
   ```

2. Implement graceful fallbacks for critical features:
   - Show cached data when available
   - Provide alternative ways to access/add accounts manually
   - Display helpful error messages with specific actions users can take

### 5. Enhance Monitoring and Diagnostics

**Actions:**
1. Implement application monitoring:
   - Add Sentry or similar error tracking
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

2. Improve logging:
   - Add request IDs to track requests across the stack
   - Log important events and user actions

3. Create a system health endpoint:
   ```javascript
   // In server/index.js
   app.get('/api/health', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Check database connection
       const dbStatus = await checkDatabaseConnection();
       
       // Check Plaid API connection
       const plaidStatus = await checkPlaidConnection();
       
       res.json({
         status: 'healthy',
         services: {
           database: dbStatus,
           plaid: plaidStatus
         }
       });
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({
         status: 'unhealthy',
         error: error.message
       });
     }
   });
   ```

### Timeline and Priorities

1. **Immediate (Today):**
   - Update environment variables in production
   - Implement basic error logging enhancements
   - Add retry logic for critical API calls
