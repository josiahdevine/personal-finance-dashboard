## Bug Fixes and Technical Improvements (2023-07-21)

### Resolved Issues
1. **Fixed Root Route Error**: Created a `RootRouteHandler` component to properly access the authentication context and handle redirects based on login state.
   - Location: `src/App.js`
   - Fix: Moved the root path redirection logic into a separate component that correctly uses the `useAuth` hook.

2. **Stripe Integration Improvements**: Enhanced Stripe integration to gracefully handle missing API keys.
   - Location: `src/utils/stripeUtils.js` and `src/App.js`
   - Changes:
     - Created utility functions for Stripe initialization
     - Added conditional rendering for Stripe Elements
     - Improved error handling for missing API keys

3. **Dashboard Layout PropTypes Fix**: Updated `DashboardLayout` component to correctly use React Router's `Outlet`.
   - Location: `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.js`
   - Fix: Removed the unnecessary `children` PropType since the component uses `Outlet` instead.

4. **Environment Configuration**: Added a comprehensive `.env.example` file with documentation for required environment variables.
   - New file: `.env.example`
   - Purpose: Assists developers in setting up the correct environment variables for local development.

### Development Environment Tips
- When running the application locally, you may need to disable ad blockers that could interfere with API calls to Stripe or other services.
- For Stripe testing, use the test keys provided in the Stripe dashboard. The keys should always start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` for testing environments.
- The application now gracefully handles missing API keys to prevent crashes during development.
